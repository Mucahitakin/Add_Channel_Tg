Here’s your README.md file in English for the script:

Telegram Group to Channel Member Adder

This script allows you to transfer members from a Telegram group to a Telegram channel using the Telethon library. The script avoids adding bots, excludes specific user IDs, and handles Telegram’s spam protection by waiting for the required time when necessary.

📌 Features
	•	✅ Select a Telegram account to use.
	•	✅ Fetch members from a selected Telegram group.
	•	✅ Add members to a selected Telegram channel.
	•	✅ Automatically waits if Telegram requests a cooldown period.
	•	✅ Ignores bots and excluded user IDs.
	•	✅ Uses random delays between member additions to prevent spam detection.

🔧 Installation

1️⃣ Install Required Dependencies

Make sure you have Python 3.7+ installed. Then, install the required dependencies:

pip install telethon

2️⃣ Set Up Your Telegram API Credentials

You need API ID and API Hash from My Telegram.
	•	Open my.telegram.org and log in with your Telegram account.
	•	Click on API Development Tools.
	•	Create a new application and get your API ID and API Hash.

3️⃣ Configure the Script

Edit the accounts list in the script and replace the placeholders:

accounts = [
    {"session": "account1", "api_id": YOUR_API_ID, "api_hash": "YOUR_API_HASH",
     "phone_number": "YOUR_PHONE_NUMBER"}
]

Replace YOUR_API_ID, YOUR_API_HASH, and YOUR_PHONE_NUMBER with your real credentials.

python script.py

Follow the on-screen instructions:
	1.	Select the Telegram account.
	2.	Choose the group from which you want to transfer members.

The script will begin adding members and handle any Telegram restrictions automatically.

⚠️ Important Notes
	•	You must be an admin in the target channel to add members.
	•	Telegram imposes limits on how many users you can add per day. If the script gets blocked, wait and try again later.
	•	Do not abuse this tool, as excessive use may lead to a temporary or permanent ban of your account.
